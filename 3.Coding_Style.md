<a name="general_guidelines"></a>
## General Guidelines

- 1 - Prefer the composition with `map`, `filter`, `reduce` and other similar functional programming operators over iterating when transforming from one collection to another.
    Make sure to avoid using closure that have side effects when using these methods.
    
    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    let stringOfInts = [1, 2, 3].flatMap { String($0) }
    // DISCOURAGED
    var stringOfInts: [String] = []
    for integer in [1, 2, 3] {
        stringOfInts.append(String(integer))
    }
    ```
    
    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    let evenNumbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42].filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
    // NOT PREFERRED
    var evenNumbers: [Int] = []
    for integer in [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42] {
        if integer % 2 == 0 {
            evenNumbers.append(integer)
        }
    }
    ```
    
- 2 - Double check retain cycles when creating delegates/protocols; typically, these properties should be declared `weak`.
- 3 - Double check for `self` to avoid retain cycles (Capture List on [Swift doc](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Closures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH11-XID_163))

    ```swift
    myFunction() { [weak self] (error) -> Void in
        // you can do this
        self?.doSomething()
    
        // or you can do this
        guard let strongSelf = self else {
            return
        }
    
        strongSelf.doSomething()
    }
    ```
    
- 4 - Donâ€™t use shorthand for class methods since it is generally more difficult to infer the context from class methods as opposed to enums.
- 5 - When writing method think if it is intended to be overridden or not (if not and it is does need to be tested you can mark it explicitly with `final` keyword). `final` methods result in improved compilation times so it's good to be used when applicable.
- 6 - Prefer `static` to `class` when declaring a function or a property associated with a class. Only use `class` if you specifically need the functionality of overriding that function or property in a subclass, though consider using a `protocol` to achieve this instead.
- 7 - If you have a function that takes no arguments, has no side effects and return some object or value prefer using a computed property instead of a function:
 
    ```swift
    // NOT PREFERRED
    function fullName() -> String {
        return "\(self.name) \(self.surname)"
    } 
    // PREFERRED
    public var fullName: String {
        return "\(self.name) \(self.surname)"
    }
    ```

<a name="variables"></a>
## Variables

- 1 - Prefer `let` to `var` if possible. A good technique is to assume everything is `let` and only change it to `var` if required to mutate.
- 2 - If the value of the property isn't known until creation, it can still be declared `let`: [assigning constant properties during initialization](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH18-ID212).
- 3 - Prefer not declaring types for constants or variables if they can be inferred anyway.
- 4 - When declaring variables you should be verbose, but not too verbose. Make the name descriptive:

    ```swift
    // Dictionary is redundant
    var someDictionary: Dictionary = [String: String]()
    // CGPoint is repeated
    var somePoint: CGPoint = CGPoint(x:100, y: 200)
    // b is not a descriptive name
    var b = Bool(false)
    ```
    
- 5 - Avoid repeating type information. Once should be enough.

<a name="constants"></a>
## Constants

- 1 - Where possible, keep constants private to the file they are related to.
- 2 - Define constants for unchanging pieces of data in the code. Some examples are CGFloat constants for cell heights, string constants for cell identifiers, key names (for KVC and dictionaries), or segue identifiers.
- 3 - If the constant is declared within a class or struct, it must be declared `static` to avoid declaring one constant per instance.
- 4 - Avoid naming constant with `k` prefixes.
- 5 - File-level constants must be declared with `fileprivate` let (omit it if constant must be used outside)

<a name="tuples"></a>
## Tuples

- 1 - If a function returns multiple value use a named tuple instead (you can omit naming if return type is obvious). If have 3 or more items in a tuple consider replacing it with a `struct` or `class` instead.
- 2 -  If you use a certain tuple more than once, consider using a `typealias` (ie. `public typealias Address = (name: String, number: Int)`.

<a name="access_modifiers"></a>
## Access Modifiers

- 1 - Access modifier must be placed first declaring a property.
    
    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    private static let myPrivateVar: Int

    // NOT PREFERRED
    static private let myPrivateVar: Int
    ```

- 2 - The access modifier keyword should be placed inline.

    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    open class MyClass {
        /* ... */
    }

    // NOT PREFERRED
    open
    class MyClass {
        /* ... */
    }
    ```
    
- 3 - Don't write `internal` modifier unless needed, it's the default scope for any var.
- 4 - When you need to set a variable open for unit testing mark it as `internal` to use `@testable import Module`. If a property should be private, but you declare it to be internal for the purposes of unit testing, make sure you add an appropriate bit of documentation commenting that explains this. You can make use of the `- warning`: markup syntax for clarity as shown below.

    ```swift
    /**
     This property defines the pirate's name.
     - warning: Not `private` for `@testable`.
     */
    let myVar = "A Value"
    ```
    
- 5 - Prefer `private` to `fileprivate` where possible.
- 6 - If you need to set something to be subclassable outside the module prefer using `open` over `public`.

<a name="custom_operators"></a>
## Custom Operators

- 1 - The creation of custom operator should be always avoided in order to make the codebase less readable. If you need to create a custom operator you can do it with a named function.
    Remember you can always override existing operastors to support new types (especially when comparing using `==`) while preserving the original semantics.
    For more guidance on best practices on this matter, view the guidelines at the bottom of this [NSHipster article](http://nshipster.com/swift-operators/#guidelines-for-swift-operators).
   
 <a name="switch_enums"></a> 
## Switch & Enums

- 1 - `break` keyword in switch statement is not required at the end of the scope unless to avoid execution. You can avoid it.
- 2 - When using a switch statement with a finite set of possibilities do not use `default` case to create a case for unused cases but place them at the bottom followed with a `break` to prevent further execution.
- 3 - `case` must be aligned at the same level of `switch` as for Swift standards.
- 4 - When defining an associated value for an `enum` be sure to describe explicitly it (ie. `case animated(duration: TimeInterval` and not `case animated(TimeInterval)`).
- 5 - Prefer using list cases over `fallthrough` keyword (ie. `case 1, 2, 3:`)
- 6 - If a case of a switch shouldn't be reached for the scope prefer manage it (with asser or throwing an error) over silently fail:

    ```swift
    func doSomethingWithNumber(_ digit: Int) throws {
        switch digit {
        case 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:
            /* ... */
        default:
            throw Error(message: "Cannot handle this value")
        }
    }
    ```
    
- 7 - Avoid writing out an `enum` type where possible - use shorthand (not `MyEnum.enumValue` but directly `.enumValue`).
  
   <a name="optionals"></a>   
## Optionals

- 1 - **Avoid force unwrapping optionals** by using `!`, `as!` or `try!` as this will cause your app to crash if the value you are trying to use is nil. Always handle the case.
- 2 - Declare variables and function return types as optional with `?` only where a `nil` value is acceptable.
- 3 - If you don't need the value of an optional but you need to determine or what if its value is `nil` **prefer explicit comparison**.

    ```swift
    // PREFERERED
    if someOptional != nil {
        /* ... */
    }
    // NOT PREFERRED
    if let _ = someOptional {
        /* ... */
    }
    ```
    
- 4 - **Avoid using `unowned`**. You can think about it as a `weak` property that is implicitly unwrapped; since we don't want to have implicit unwraps we should also avoid `unowned` properties.

    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    weak var myViewController: UIViewController?
    // NOT PREFERRED
    weak var myViewController: UIViewController!
    unowned var myViewController: UIViewController
    ```
    
- 5 - When **unwrapping a variable use the same name of the unwrapped constant/variable** where appropriate.

    ```swift
    guard let aValue = aValue else {
        /* ... */
    }
    ```
    
- 6 - **Use multiple optional binding in an `if`** let statement where possible to avoid the pyramid of doom:

    ```swift
    if let id = json[Constants.id] as? Int {
        if let firstName = json[Constants.firstName] as? String {
            if let lastName = json[Constants.lastName] as? String {
                if let initials = json[Constants.initials] as? String {
                    /* ... */
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Correct
    
    ```swift
    if
        let id = json[Constants.Id] as? Int,
        let firstName = json[Constants.firstName] as? String,
        let lastName = json[Constants.lastName] as? String,
        let initials = json[Constants.initials] as? String {
            /* ... */
    }
    ```
    
- 7 - When using `guard`, `if`, or while to unwrap multiple optionals, put each constant and/or variable onto its own line, followed by a `,` except for the last line, which should be followed by `else {` for guard (though this may be on its own line), or `{` for if and while.

    ```swift
    if
        let constantOne = valueOne,
        let constantTwo = valueTwo,
        let constantThree = valueThree {
            // Code
    }
    ```
    
<a name="protocols"></a>
## Protocols

- 1 - When implementing protocols you can organize your code:

    - 1 Using `// MARK:` comments to separate protocol implementation from the rest of the code.
    - 2 Creating an extension outside your `class`/`struct` implementation but inside the same source file.
    
    Note: when using #2 methods in extension can't be overridden by an eventual subclass and it makes unit tests difficult to be made. BTW #2 allows a more cleaner separation of concerns.

- 2 - If your protocol should have [optional methods](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH25-ID284), it must be declared with the `@objc` attribute.
- 3 - If more than one class uses the same protocol, declare it in its own file.
- 4 - Limit delegate protocols to classes only by adding `class` to the protocol's inheritance list (as discussed in [Class-Only Protocols](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH25-ID281)).

<a name="properties"></a>
## Properties

- 1 - If you are making a read-only computed property avoid explicitly declare `get { }` around the block of code. It's not needed.

    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    var diameter: Double {
        return radius * 2
    }
    // NOT PREFERRED
    var diameter: Double {
        get {
            return radius * 2
        }
    }
    ```
    
- 2 - Code inside `get {}`, `set {}`, `willSet` and `didSet` must be indent.
- 3 - Use standard `newValue` and `oldValue` for `set/get` blocks.
- 4 - Singleton creation must be done in this way

    ```swift
    class NetworkManager {
        static let shared = NetworkManager()
        /* ... */
    }
    ```
    
- 5 - Consider using `lazy` initialization of objects for finer grained control over object lifetime or to reduce allocation if needed in special cases.
    
<a name="ternary_operator"></a>
## Ternary Operator

The Ternary operator, `?:` , should only be used when it increases clarity or code neatness. A single condition is usually all that should be evaluated.

Evaluating multiple conditions is usually more understandable as an if statement or refactored into instance variables. In general, the best use of the ternary operator is during assignment of a variable and deciding which value to use.

Moreover complex operations with ternary operator are difficult to be evaluated and inferred and should be avoided.

```swift
// PREFERRED
let value = 5
result = value != 0 ? x : y

// NOT PREFERRED
result = a > b ? x = c > d ? c : d : y
```

<a name="closures"></a>
## Closures

- 1 - When declaring parameters inside a closure you can also omit the type if obvious.
    
    ```swift
    // omitting the type
    doSomethingWithClosure() { response in
        print(response)
    }

    // explicit type
    doSomethingWithClosure() { response: NSURLResponse in
        print(response)
    }
    ```
    
- 2 - If does not exceed the limit of line width prefer keeping parameter names on the same line of the opening brace.
- 3 - Only use shorthand argument syntax for simple one-line closure implementations:

    ```swift
    let doubled = [2, 3, 4].map { $0 * 2 } // [4, 6, 8]
    ```
    
    For complex cases explicitly define the argument:
    
    ```swift
    let names = ["George Washington", "Martha Washington", "Abe Lincoln"]
    let emails = names.map { fullname in
        let dottedName = fullname.replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: ".")
        return dottedName.lowercased() + "@whitehouse.gov"
    }
    ```
    
- 4 - Use trailing closure syntax only if there is a single closure expression parameter at the end of the argument list. Give the closure parameters descriptive names.

    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0 {
        /* ... */
    }
    UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
        /* ... */
    }, completion: { finished in
        /* ... */
    }
    // NOT PREFERRED
    UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
        /* ... */
    }, { finished in
        /* ... */
    }
    ```

<a name="delegates"></a>
## Delegates

- 1 - When creating custom delegate methods, an unamed fist parameter should be the delegate source (UIKit contains numerous example of this behaviour)
    
    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    func customPickerView(_ pickerView: CustomPickerView, numberOfRows: Int)
    // NOT PREFERRED
    func customPickerView(pickerView: CustomPickerView, numberOfRows: Int)
    ```

<a name="array"></a>
## Array

- 1 - Avoid accessing an array directly with subscripts but use accessors such as `.first` or `.last` which guarantee safety when item is not available.
    If you can't user accessor make sure to do proper bound checking first.
- 2 - Prefer `for item in items` syntax instead of `for i in 0 ..< items.count` if possible.
- 3 - Prefer `.append()` or `.append(contentsOf:)` method instead of using `+=` operator in order to concatenate array (currently they're more performant, at least with respect to compilation).

<a name="guard"></a>
## Using `guard`

- 1 - "Early return" is the preferred way to make sanity checks on a function and it should the preferred way to avoid nested `if` statements. In order to achieve this strategy the use of `guard` is helpful and can improve the readability of the code.

    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    func doSomethingWithItem(at index: Int) {
        guard index >= 0 && index < item.count else {
            // return early because the index is out of bounds
            return
        }
    
        let item = item[index]
        doSomethingWithObject(item)
    }
    
    // NOT PREFERRED
    func doSomethingWithItem(at index: Int) {
        if index >= 0 && index < item.count {
            let item = item[index]
            doSomethingWithObject(item)
        }
    }
    ```
    
    This approach is called "Golden Path"; in fact the left-hand margin of the code should be the "golden" or "happy" path. That is, don't nest if statements. Multiple return statements are OK. The guard statement is built for this.

- 2 - Avoid nested `if` statements and decrease the amount of nested indentation in your code: prefer `guard` statements as opposed to `if` statements to make sanity  checks.

    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    guard let anObject = anObject else {
        return
    }
    doSomething(with: anObject)
    doAnotherStuff(with: anObject)
    
    // NOT PREFERRED
    if let anObject = anObject {
        doSomething(with: anObject)
        doAnotherStuff(with: anObject)
    }
    
    // NOT PREFERRED
    if anObject == nil {
        return
    }
    doSomething(with: anObject!)
    doAnotherStuff(with: anObject!)
    ```
    
- 3 - Avoid using `guard` statements on a single line.

    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    guard let aValue = aValue else {
        return
    }
    
    // NOT PREFERRED
    guard let aValue = aValue else { return }
    ```
    
- 4 -  `guard` should be used only if a failure should result in exiting the current context; if the context needs to continue prefer one or more `if` statements instead. The goal of `guard` is to perform early check and returns.
- 5 - If choosing between two different states, it makes more sense to use an if statement as opposed to a guard statement.
    
    ```swift
    // PREFERRED
    if aCondition {
        /* code A */
    } else {
        /* code B */
    }
    
    // NOT PREFERRED
    guard aCondition else {
        /* code B */
        return
    }
    /* code A */
    ```

<a name="error_handling"></a>
## Error Handling

- 1 - Generally error must be handled in order to provide an action, a recovery options or just a message. Crash on error is never an accepted solution; where possible a recovery must be provided with additional logging.

    Suppose a function `myFunction` which return a `String`, however, at some point it can run into an error. A common approach is to have this function return an optional `String?` where we return `nil` if something went wrong.
    
    A more viable solution to optional is to use Swift's `try/catch` behaviour especially if it is appropriate to know the reason for the failure.
    In general, if a method can "fail", and the reason for the failure is not immediately obvious if using an optional return type, it probably makes sense for the method to throw an error.
    
    Instead, when the result should semantically potentially be nil as opposed to something going wrong while retrieving the result, it makes sense to return an optional instead of using error handling.

- 2 - Avoid using the forced-try expression `try!` as a way to ignore errors from throwing methods as this will crash your app if the error actually gets thrown. Safely handle errors using a do statement along with try and catch. A rare reason to use the forced-try expression is similar to force unwrapping optionals; you actually want the app to crash (ideally during debugging before the app ships) to indicate an implementation error. An example of this would be loading a bundle resource that should always be there unless you forgot to include it or rename it.

<a name="unused_code"></a>
## Unused Code

Unused code (including Xcode template code and placeholder comments) should be removed. 

<a name="importing_modules"></a>
## Importing Modules

Import only the modules a source file requires.
For example, don't import `UIKit` when importing `Foundation` will suffice.

<a name="using_self"></a>
## Using of `self`

For conciseness, avoid using self since Swift does not require it to access an object's properties or invoke its methods.

Use self only when required by the compiler (in `@escaping` closures, or in initializers to disambiguate properties from arguments).
In other words, if it compiles without self then omit it.

<a name="classes_structs"></a>
## Classes or Structs

**Common Properties**
- They can define properties to store values and they can define functions
- They can define subscripts to provide access to values with subscript syntax (ie. `items["myValue"]` or `items[1]`).
- They can define initializers to setup their initial state
- They can be extended with extensions
- They can conform to protocols

Out of the box classes are more versatile than structs (at a cost) and support few more capabilities that structs don't have:

- Classes can inherit from another classes and support type casting
- Classes can be deinitialized (can call `deinit()` before deallocation)
- You can create one or more *references* to a single class

**Summary***

In fact:
- Classes are [reference types](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-XID_145), they increase their reference count when passed to a function or assigned to a variable or constant.
- Structs are so called [value types](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-XID_144). That means that when a struct is assigned to a variable or constant or passed to a function its value is copied instead of increasing its reference count. 

**Structs or Classes**

Most of your custom data types should be classes.
- Some situations where you may want to use structs:
    - When creating simple, lightweight data types.
    - When creating types that are composed of other value types (which would also be expected to be copied rather than referenced).
    - When you don't need inheritance.

<a name="loops"></a>
## Loops
- 1 - Use the enumerated() function if you need to loop over a Sequence and use the index:

    ```swift
    for (index, element) in someArray.enumerated() {
        /* ... */
    }
    ```
    
- 2 - If you are not performing a transform, or if there are side effects do not use `map/compactMap`; use a for in loop instead ([tips](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/when-to-use-map-flatmap-for/)).

<a name="doc_comments"></a>
## Documentation & Comments

Documentation is important; Xcode provides an extensive markup syntax to produce a rich and complete documentation ([read it](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/Attention.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016497-CH29-SW1)).

Generally code should be clear enough which does not need to be documented. Before adding documentation to your code you should ask yourself if why it needs to be documented.

If a function is more complicated than a simple O(1) operation, you should generally consider adding a doc comment for the function since there could be some information that the method signature does not make immediately obvious. If there are any quirks to the way that something was implemented, whether technically interesting, tricky, not obvious, etc., this should be documented.

Documentation should be added for complex classes/structs/enums/protocols and properties. All public functions/classes/properties/constants/structs/enums/protocols/etc. should be documented as well (provided, again, that their signature/name does not make their meaning/functionality immediately obvious).

After writing a doc comment, you should option click the function/property/class/etc. to make sure that everything is formatted correctly.

- 1 - Comments should be 160 characters long, as like the rest of the code.
- 2 - Documentation must be inside `/** */` block, even if the doc comment takes up just one line.
- 3 - Avoid prefixing comments line with `*`, its not recessary.
- 4 - Use the built-in 'Add Documentation' shortcut once you made the signature and to use the new syntax of XCode.
- 5 -  Complex classes must include a description of the usage with some potential examples as seems appropriate. Remember that markdown syntax is valid in Swift's comment docs. Newlines, lists, etc. are therefore appropriate.
- 6 - When mentioning variables or other portion of code in documentation insert it between ` characters.
- 7 - Documentation should be coincise and complete.
- 8 - Leave comments on their own line.
- 9 - When using `// MARK: -` whatever, leave a newline after the comment.
- 10 - Always leave a space after `//`
